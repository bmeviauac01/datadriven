## How to work during the seminar

The exercises are solved together with the instructor. A few exercises we can try to solve by ourselves and then discuss the results. The final exercise is individual work if time permits.

!!! info ""
    This guide summarizes and explains the behavior. Before looking at these provided answers, we should think first!

## Exercise 0: Create database, open starter code

1. Open a _PowerShell_ console (search for PowerShell in the Start menu and start it, but _not_ the one with "ISE" in the same - that is not the console).

1. Copy and paste the script into the console and run it by pressing enter. Please note, that you might need to change the the directory name in the last command, e.g., if the app version is different.

    ```powershell
    Remove-Item c:\work\mongodatabase -Recurse -ErrorAction Ignore
    New-Item -Type Directory c:\work\mongodatabase
    c:\tools\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath c:\work\mongodatabase
    ```

    Keep this window open because the server is running here. You can stop it by pressing ++ctrl+c++ at the end of the class.

1. Launch VSCode and connect to the MongoDB server with the extension.

1. Let us create a new database by right-clicking the connection (_localhost_). This opens a playground script window, where we paste our database creation script from [innen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmeviauac01/datadriven/master/overrides/db/mongo.js), and run it with the black “play” button found in the header. The name of the database should be `datadriven`. As a result, the collections should be created - open the elements of the database to check this.

    ![Connection Settings](images/vscode-newdb.png)

    ![Created Collections](images/vscode-collections.png)

1. Download the starter solution!

    - Open a **new** _command prompt_ or PowerShell console (do not use the one the server is running in)
    - Navigate to a folder, e.g. `c:\work\NEPTUN`
    - Execute the following command:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/bmeviauac01/gyakorlat-mongo-kiindulo.git
        ```

1. Open the _sln_ file from the newly created folder using Visual Studio. Let us examine this project.

    - This is a .NET console application. The structure resembles the structure of the Entity Framework project seen before: directory `Entities` contains the database entities while our code will be written into `Program.cs`.
    - `Program.cs` already contains the initialization of the connection to MongoDB.
        - Interface `IMongoClient` is used for all communication with the database. We will not use this directly.
        - Interface `IMongoDatabase` represents the database `datadriven` within the MongoDB server.
        - And the `IMongoCollection<TEntity>` interfaces represent the specific collections we can use to execute queries and modification commands.
    - The database documents are mapped to the C# entity classes in folder `Entities`. A major difference compared to the behavior previously seen in Entity Framework is that these classes were not generated by written manually.
        - Most entities are already mapped.
        - We will create one more class during an exercise.

## Exercise 1: Queries

Write C# code using the _MongoDB C#/.NET Driver_ in the following exercises. Print the results to the console.

1. List the names and the amount of stock of all products that we have more than 30 in stock!

1. List the orders that consist of at least two items!

1. List the orders that have a total value of at least 30.000! For each order, print the customer name, and list all items of the order (with the product name, amount, and price).

1. Find the most expensive product(s)! If there are multiple products with the same highest price, list the details of all of them.

1. List the products that have been ordered at least twice!

??? example "Solution"
    1. We need only the product collection and execute a simple query. The filter criteria can be written as a Lambda-expression and with the builder syntax too.

        ```csharp
        Console.WriteLine("***** Exercise one *****");

        // 1.1 first solution
        Console.WriteLine("\t1.1 First solution:");
        var qProductAndStock1 = productsCollection
            .Find(p => p.Stock > 30)
            .ToList();

        foreach (var p in qProductAndStock1)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tName={p.Name}\tStock={p.Stock}");

        // 1.1 second solution
        Console.WriteLine("\t1.1 Second solution:");
        var qProductAndStock2 = productsCollection
            .Find(Builders<Product>.Filter.Gt(p => p.Stock, 30))
            .ToList();

        foreach (var p in qProductAndStock2)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tName={p.Name}\tStock={p.Stock}");
        ```

    1. This is similar to the previous one. We may note that we would have needed a join in a relational database, but we have everything at hand here.

        ```csharp
        // 1.2 first solution
        Console.WriteLine("\t1.2 First solution:");
        var qOrderItems1 = ordersCollection
            .Find(o => o.OrderItems.Length >= 2)
            .ToList();

        foreach (var o in qOrderItems1)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tCustomerID={o.CustomerID}\tOrderID={o.ID}\tItems={o.OrderItems.Length}");

        // 1.2 second solution
        Console.WriteLine("\t1.2 Second solution:");
        var qOrderItems2 = ordersCollection
            .Find(Builders<Order>.Filter.SizeGte(o => o.OrderItems, 2))
            .ToList();

        foreach (var o in qOrderItems2)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tCustomerID={o.CustomerID}\tOrderID={o.ID}\tItems={o.OrderItems.Length}");
        ```

    1. A simple query is not sufficient for this exercise; thus, we need the aggregation pipeline. We may still note that every information we need is still available in one collection.

        ```csharp
        // 1.3
        Console.WriteLine("\t1.3:");
        var qOrderTotal = ordersCollection
            .Aggregate()
            .Project(order => new
            {
                CustomerID = order.CustomerID,
                OrderItems = order.OrderItems,
                Total = order.OrderItems.Sum(oi => oi.Amount * oi.Price)
            })
            .Match(order => order.Total > 30000)
            .ToList();

        foreach (var o in qOrderTotal)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tCustomerID={o.CustomerID}");
            foreach (var oi in o.OrderItems)
                Console.WriteLine($"\t\t\tProductID={oi.ProductID}\tPrice={oi.Price}\tAmount={oi.Amount}");
        }
        ```

    1. To find the most expensive product, we need two queries: first, find the largest price value, then find the products with this price.

        ```csharp
        // 1.4
        Console.WriteLine("\t1.4:");
        var maxPrice = productsCollection
            .Find(_ => true)
            .SortByDescending(p => p.Price)
            .Limit(1)
            .Project(p => p.Price)
            .Single();

        var qProductMax = productsCollection
            .Find(p => p.Price == maxPrice)
            .ToList();

        foreach (var t in qProductMax)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tName={t.Name}\tPrice={t.Price}");
        ```

    1. This exercise is complicated with our current database scheme because we do not have everything at hand within one collection. We need the product information from one collection, and the order details from another one.

        **Recommended solution: Using MongoDB aggregation pipeline**

        The most efficient solution is to use MongoDB's aggregation pipeline with the `$lookup` operator, which performs the "join" operation on the server side. This scales well even for large databases since we don't need to load all data into memory.

        ```csharp
        // 1.5 - Recommended solution with aggregation pipeline
        Console.WriteLine("\t1.5:");
        var pipeline = new[]
        {
            // Unwind the order items
            new BsonDocument("$unwind", "$orderItems"),
            // Group by product and count orders
            new BsonDocument("$group", new BsonDocument
            {
                { "_id", "$orderItems.productID" },
                { "orderCount", new BsonDocument("$sum", 1) }
            }),
            // Filter products ordered at least twice
            new BsonDocument("$match", new BsonDocument("orderCount", new BsonDocument("$gte", 2))),
            // Join with products collection
            new BsonDocument("$lookup", new BsonDocument
            {
                { "from", "products" },
                { "localField", "_id" },
                { "foreignField", "_id" },
                { "as", "product" }
            }),
            // Unwind the product array
            new BsonDocument("$unwind", "$product"),
            // Project the fields we need
            new BsonDocument("$project", new BsonDocument
            {
                { "productName", "$product.name" },
                { "stock", "$product.stock" },
                { "orderCount", 1 }
            })
        };

        var results = ordersCollection.Aggregate<BsonDocument>(pipeline).ToList();

        foreach (var result in results)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tName={result["productName"]}\tStock={result["stock"]}\tOrders={result["orderCount"]}");
        }
        ```

        Benefits of this solution:
        - **Does not load all data into memory**, only the results
        - **Runs on the server side**, leveraging MongoDB's indexes and optimization
        - **Scalable**: efficient even for large databases

        **Alternative solution: Client-side join (only recommended for small databases)**

        If needed, the task can also be solved on the client side, but this is only recommended for small databases:

        ```csharp
        // 1.5 - Alternative solution (memory intensive!)
        Console.WriteLine("\t1.5 (alternative):");
        var qOrders = ordersCollection
            .Find(_ => true)
            .ToList();

        var productOrders = qOrders
            .SelectMany(o => o.OrderItems) // All order items into one list
            .GroupBy(oi => oi.ProductID)
            .Where(p => p.Count() >= 2);

        var qProducts = productsCollection
            .Find(_ => true)
            .ToList();
        var productLookup = qProducts.ToDictionary(p => p.ID);

        foreach (var p in productOrders)
        {
            var product = productLookup.GetValueOrDefault(p.Key);
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tName={product?.Name}\tStock={product?.Stock}\tOrders={p.Count()}");
        }
        ```

        **Warning:** The alternative solution loads all orders and products into memory, which can lead to performance issues and out-of-memory errors with large databases. Always use MongoDB's aggregation pipeline in production environments!

## Exercise 2: Create a new entity class

1. Examine the classes `Product` and `VAT`. Why is there a field with a `[BsonId]` attribute in class `Product` and not in class `VAT`?

1. Create a new entity class for mapping `Category` document, then add and initialize a `IMongoCollection<Category>` field next to the others.

??? example "Solution"
    1. Class `Product` represents the `products` collection; therefore each item has a unique `ObjectID`. On the other hand, class `VAT` is an embedded field used by `Product` and has no collection on its own; hence it needs no id.

    1. Create our new `Category` POCO class.

        Let us check a few sample documents using VSCode in `categories` collection.

        ![Categories documents](images/categories.png)

        Create a new class `Category` in folder `Entities` with matching fields as below.

        ```csharp
        using MongoDB.Bson;
        using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Attributes;

        namespace BME.DataDriven.Mongo.Entitites
        {
            public class Category
            {
                [BsonId]
                public ObjectId ID { get; set; }
                public string Name { get; set; }
                public ObjectId? ParentCategoryID { get; set; }
            }
        }
        ```

        Add a new collection interface field in `Program.cs` as follows.

        ```csharp
        private static IMongoCollection<Category> categoriesCollection;
        ```

        And assign the value in the `initialize` method to get the collection.

        ```csharp
        categoriesCollection = database.GetCollection<Category>("categories");
        ```

## Exercise 3: Data modification

The collection classes `IMongoColection<TEntity>` can also be used to execute modification operations.

1. Write C# code that increases the price of all products in category "LEGO" by 10 percent!

1. Create a new category named _Expensive toys_ and move all products here that cost more than 8000!

1. Delete all categories that contain no products.

??? example "Solution"
    1. Find the ID of the category then update all products that have this category id.

        ```csharp
        Console.WriteLine("***** Exercise three *****");

        //3.1
        Console.WriteLine("\t3.1:");
        var categoryLegoId = categoriesCollection
            .Find(c => c.Name == "LEGO")
            .Project(c => c.ID)
            .Single();

        var qProductLego = productsCollection
            .Find(p => p.CategoryID == categoryLegoId)
            .ToList();
        Console.WriteLine("\t\tBefore modification:");
        foreach (var p in qProductLego)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\t\tName={p.Name}\tStock={p.Stock}\tÁr={p.Price}");

        productsCollection.UpdateMany(
            filter: p => p.CategoryID == categoryLegoId,
            update: Builders<Product>.Update.Mul(p => p.Price, 1.1));

        qProductLego = productsCollection
            .Find(p => p.CategoryID == categoryLegoId)
            .ToList();
        Console.WriteLine("\t\tAfter modification:");
        foreach (var p in qProductLego)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\t\tName={p.Name}\tStock={p.Stock}\tÁr={p.Price}");
        ```

    1. MongoDB can execute the following sequence of steps in a single atomic step: "Get me category `Expensive toys`. If it does not exist, create it." We will use `FindOneAndUpdate` to achieve this.

        ```csharp
        //3.2
        Console.WriteLine("\t3.2:");
        var catExpensiveToys = categoriesCollection.FindOneAndUpdate<Category>(
            filter: c => c.Name == "Expensive toys",
            update: Builders<Category>.Update.SetOnInsert(c => c.Name, "Expensive toys"),
            options: new FindOneAndUpdateOptions<Category, Category> { IsUpsert = true, ReturnDocument = ReturnDocument.After });

        productsCollection.UpdateMany(
            filter: p => p.Price > 8000,
            update: Builders<Product>.Update.Set(p => p.CategoryID, catExpensiveToys.ID));

        var qProdExpensive = productsCollection
            .Find(p => p.CategoryID == catExpensiveToys.ID)
            .ToList();
        foreach (var p in qProdExpensive)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tName={p.Name}\tPrice={p.Price}");
        ```

    1. Query categories that contain any product, then delete the ones that do not belong among this list.

        ```csharp
        //3.3
        Console.WriteLine("\t3.3:");
        Console.WriteLine($"\t\tBefore modification: {categoriesCollection.CountDocuments(_ => true)} categories");

        var qProductCategory = new HashSet<ObjectId>(
            productsCollection
                .Find(_ => true)
                .Project(p => p.CategoryID)
                .ToList());

        categoriesCollection.DeleteMany(c => !qProductCategory.Contains(c.ID));

        Console.WriteLine($"\t\tAfter modification: {categoriesCollection.CountDocuments(_ => true)} categories");
        ```

        Let us note that this is not an atomic operation. If a product was added concurrently, we could have deleted its category.
